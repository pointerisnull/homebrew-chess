# homebrew-chess
This was my final project for my CS class (which is why it's written in Java), fall semester 2023. I'm uploading this for archival reasons, or if I ever decide to finish it later (doubt). 

Anyways, the goal of this project was to implement a chess board in java that could be interacted with, and which obeyed the rules of chess. Every piece has it's correct movement/capture rules, however I did not implement a turn based system. I guess you could say that this is the version of chess you and your siblings played as a kid. Also, I forgot to add the bishop's collision detection, so it can snipe any piece diagonal from it, regardless of what's in the way. Oh, and now that I think about it, I also forgot to implement 'check'. It doesn't matter, I passed the class. Also, you may notice that every single function has a huge comment block that gives an overly verbose explaination of what the function does. Not my design choice, it was part of the curriculum. Although it does not follow my philosophy for writing software, the end result of this project was a neat little program that is entertaining to play with for a little bit.
